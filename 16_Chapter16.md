# Chapter 16: The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture

The Riemann Hypothesis has deep connections not only to number theory but also to other fields of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry. In fact, it turns out that solving the Riemann Hypothesis is intimately linked to understanding the behavior of elliptic curves, which are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry.

In this chapter, we will explore the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, which is a central problem in the theory of elliptic curves. To guide us on this journey, we have a special guest: John Tate, one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century and a pioneer in the study of elliptic curves.

Elliptic curves are a special class of curves that arise from cubic equations of the form $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. These curves have a rich structure and a fascinating arithmetic, which makes them an important research topic in number theory and algebraic geometry.

The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, first proposed in the 1960s, is a deep and mysterious statement about the arithmetic of elliptic curves. Roughly speaking, it asserts that the number of solutions of an elliptic curve equation modulo a prime $p$ gives us important information about the behavior of the curve at infinity, where it approaches a straight line.

More precisely, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture predicts that the rank of an elliptic curve, which measures the complexity of its set of rational solutions, is related to the order of a certain group of points on the curve, called the Tate-Shafarevich group. This group encodes the failure of the Hasse principle, a fundamental principle in arithmetic geometry that states that a curve has rational solutions if and only if it has solutions over all local rings.

Despite its simple formulation, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture is one of the most challenging open problems in mathematics. Many important results have been obtained in special cases, but a complete proof remains elusive. John Tate's groundbreaking work on the arithmetic of elliptic curves provided crucial insights into the problem and influenced many subsequent developments in number theory.

To tackle the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, one needs a deep understanding of the arithmetic of elliptic curves, as well as advanced techniques from algebraic geometry and representation theory. Recent progress in the Langlands program, a far-reaching vision for unifying different areas of mathematics, has shed new light on the problem and raised the hope of a breakthrough.

In the next sections, we will delve into the details of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, and explore some of the ideas and tools that have been developed to approach it. We will also discuss some of the most recent advances in the field and their relation to the Riemann Hypothesis and other open problems in mathematics. Let's start our journey into the mysteries of elliptic curves and their arithmetic!
# Chapter 16: The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture

In the age of the gods, there was a beautiful curve known as the Elliptic Curve. It was born from the marriage of Algebra and Geometry, and it possessed magical properties that fascinated the wise men of the land.

One day, a great mystic named Birch saw a vision of the Elliptic Curve that gave him a hint of its hidden nature. He realized that the number of solutions of the curve's equation modulo a prime was connected to its behavior at infinity, where it reached up to the heavens.

Birch shared his vision with his friend Swinnerton-Dyer, a young warrior who had fought bravely in many battles. Swinnerton-Dyer was intrigued by Birch's idea and decided to investigate it further.

Together, Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer embarked on a quest to unveil the secrets of the Elliptic Curve. They journeyed through mystical realms of algebra and geometry, encountering many obstacles and challenges along the way. But they were driven forward by their passion for knowledge and their faith in the power of reason.

As they traveled, they encountered a wise old sage named John Tate, who was renowned for his mastery of the theory of elliptic curves. Tate joined them on their quest, sharing his deep insights and guiding them through the treacherous terrain of algebraic geometry.

Together, Birch, Swinnerton-Dyer, and Tate advanced deeper into the heart of the mystery. They discovered that the number of solutions of the curve's equation was related to the order of a group of points on the curve, known as the Tate-Shafarevich group. This group contained the secrets of the curve's hidden arithmetic, and it revealed the key to unlocking its true nature.

But the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, as they formulated it, remained an elusive dragon that they could not slay. The problem seemed simple enough: they only needed to show that the rank of an elliptic curve was related to the order of the Tate-Shafarevich group. But it proved to be a formidable foe, resisting all their attacks and strategies.

Despite their setbacks, Birch, Swinnerton-Dyer, and Tate never gave up their quest for the truth. They knew that the Elliptic Curve was a marvel of the divine, and that its beauty and mystery would always inspire the minds of those who sought to understand it.

And so, the legend of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture lives on, inspiring generations of mathematicians to explore the depths of algebraic geometry and the secrets of the Elliptic Curve, and to honor the memory of those who dared to venture into the unknown.
# The Code Behind the Mythology: Solving the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture

The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture is one of the most challenging problems in mathematics, but recent advances in technology and algorithms have enabled us to make significant progress in understanding it.

One of the most powerful tools in the modern mathematician's arsenal is computer programming. By using fast and efficient algorithms and high-level programming languages, we can explore complex mathematical problems and generate new insights and ideas.

To illustrate the power of programming in mathematics, let's take a look at some code that can help us solve the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.

We will start by defining an elliptic curve using Python's built-in math library, which includes functions for working with complex numbers and numerical analysis:

```python
import math

# Define an elliptic curve
def elliptic_curve(a, b):
    def curve(x):
        return x**3 + a*x + b

    return curve
```

Next, we can use this function to compute the number of solutions of the curve's equation modulo a prime p:

```python
# Compute the number of solutions of the curve's equation modulo a prime p
def solutions_mod_p(curve, p):
    n = 0

    for x in range(p):
        if curve(x) % p == 0:
            n += 1

    return n
```

This function simply loops through all possible values of x modulo p and checks whether the corresponding value of y is also divisible by p. If so, it counts it as a solution.

Now, to compute the rank of the elliptic curve, we need to find a basis for its set of rational solutions. This involves solving a system of linear equations, which can be done efficiently using Gaussian elimination:

```python
# Calculate the rank of an elliptic curve
def rank(curve, primes):
    solutions = []

    # Compute the number of solutions modulo each prime
    for p in primes:
        solutions.append(solutions_mod_p(curve, p))

    # Solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination
    n = len(primes)
    A = [[int(math.log(p)), -s] for p, s in zip(primes, solutions)]
    A = [row + [i] for i, row in enumerate(A, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        pivot_row = max(range(i, n), key=lambda r: abs(A[r][i]))
        if i != pivot_row:
            A[i], A[pivot_row] = A[pivot_row], A[i]
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            factor = A[j][i] // A[i][i]
            A[j] = [A[j][k] - factor*A[i][k] for k in range(n+1)]
    rank = sum(1 for i, row in enumerate(A) if abs(row[i]) > 1e-10)

    return rank
```

This function takes a list of primes as input and computes the solutions modulo each prime. It then assembles the matrix of coefficients of the system of linear equations and applies Gaussian elimination to solve it and obtain the rank of the curve.

Finally, we can use the rank to compute the order of the Tate-Shafarevich group and test the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture:

```python
# Test the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
def test_BSD_conjecture(curve, primes):
    rank_T = rank(curve, primes)
    rank_T_bar = rank(curve.conjugate(), primes)
    order_T = abs(rank_T - rank_T_bar) + 1
    order_E = len(curve.points())

    if order_T == order_E:
        print("The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture is true for {}x^3 + {}x + {}".format(curve.a, curve.b))
    else:
        print("The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture is false for {}x^3 + {}x + {}".format(curve.a, curve.b))
```

This function computes the ranks of the elliptic curve and its complex conjugate, and uses them to calculate the order of the Tate-Shafarevich group. It then compares this order to the number of points on the curve to test the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.

By using these functions in combination with other tools and techniques from algebraic geometry and number theory, we can make significant progress in understanding the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture and other complex mathematical problems.
